# GIFT EXCHANGE PROBLEM

Imagine that every year your company does a "Secret Santa" gift exchange. For this gift exchange, each person draws another person at random and then gets a gift for them.

Write a program that will choose a Secret Santa for everyone given a list of all the employees of the company. Obviously, a person cannot be their own Secret Santa.
